## How to buy SOL

### Choose an exchange market
Today the choice of markets where you can buy SOL is wide, the most popular are Binance,  Digifinex, Coinbase, Gate.io, Kraken.
But there are many more, you can find them on Coingecko.
Different markets have different conditions on fees and provide various services, be sure to choose the one which will match you.
###  Create your account
To complete the purchase you’ll need to create an account on the chosen platform. In most cases, you’ll only need to provide your email and secure password, but some markets also require more personal information. Be sure you enable 2-factor authentication whenever possible to secure your funds.
### Buy SOL
Markets like Binance have the option of buying cryptocurrency with a credit card or bank transfer. In this case, to purchase tokens you just need to enter the amount of money you wish to spend and complete the payment.

If the direct buy is not available, you can trade for SOL. To do this you need to deposit fiat currency into your account. After that, you are going to be able to trade or send your funds to another wallet.

In some cases, there is no possibility to trade fiat for SOL. To solve this problem you’ll need to find a third cryptocurrency that is able to be traded or converted into SOL (Most likely it’s going to be [stablecoin](/FAQ/Glossary#stablecoin)).

###  Congratulations! 
Now, when you have your SOL tokens it’s time to stake them in Sibe! But first, you need to create your own [custodial](/FAQ/Glossary#custodial--non-custodial-protocol) wallet. 
If you are interested in getting to know Solana closer, read their documentation.

## How to create wallet

### What is a wallet?
Wallet is an instrument for assessing and managing your account on blockchain by yourself.
There are keys containing a set of 12 or 24 words that can be used to access your funds from other devices, it’s important to store it securely because anyone who has it can access your account. 
On the Solana network, there are SPL wallets that support the handling of SPL tokens (like Sibe). 

### What wallet can I use?
These are wallets that can be used with Sibe protocol: 
* [SolFlare](https://solflare.com/), the first non-custodial wallet released on Solana with a mobile version.
* [Phantom](https://phantom.app/)
* [Sollet.io](https://www.sollet.io/) is a SPL wallet built by the Serum team

## How to Stake SOL
If you are starting from scratch, [stake SOL](#stake-sol) is your way, but for users who already staking and want to tokenize their already existing stake on Sibe, there is [deposit stake account instruction](#deposit-stake-account).
### Stake SOL
The first step is to visit the Sibe website. 

When you need to connect your wallet via the button “Connect wallet”. Choose the wallet you wish to connect. When the connection is complete, the amount of SOl you have will be detected automatically. 

After that, enter the sum you want to stake in the “Stake SOL” section. By clicking the “Stake” button you’ll trigger a transaction. Last but not least you need to approve the transaction in the pop-up. 

That’s it! Congratulations, you’ve staked your SOL tokens and received Sibe. 

### Deposit stake account
 
For those who have already staked their SOL but wish to reassign their staking positions to Sibe, the first two steps are going to be the same as for those who are staking for the first time. Start with visiting the Sibe website and connecting your wallet via the button “Connect wallet”.
 
Next, choose “Deposit stake account” in the “Stake” section. It will take some time to load the [stake accounts](/FAQ/Glossary#stake-account) you have. 
 
As soon as it’s done, choose the account you would like to make the deposit with. Now press the “Stake” button and confirm the transaction in a pop-up. 
 
All your staked tokens and rewards are going to be converted into staking derivatives. Check your wallet to be sure you received your Sibe tokens and you are done. Congratulations!
