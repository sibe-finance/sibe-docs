## What is Sibe protocol?
It’s a protocol built on Solana, identified as a [non-custodial](/FAQ/Glossary#custodial--non-custodial-protocol) liquid staking. It gives you the ability to stake your SOL tokens to get Sibe tokens that can be utilized in decentralized finance (DeFi). The price of staking derivative rises relatively to SOL every [epoch](/FAQ/Glossary#epoch), with rewards accumulating as SOL tokens.

Withdrawal is available anytime. It requires a fee if you need to complete it immediately, but if you want to do it for free you need to unstake and wait for the unlock period (2 epochs). Moreover, direct exchange between SIBE and SOL can be done with secondary markets at the current rate.

## What are the benefits of staking SOL?
To make the process of transaction validation, decentralized and secure consensus protocols are used in blockchain. You can find more detailed information about it in Solana’s docs.
The process of staking tokens to [validators](/FAQ/Glossary#validators) helps the network to be secured and involves users in the decentralization of Solana. As a reward for locking tokens, users get SOL.

The more SOL is staked to efficient validators, the better it is for decentralization and security of Solana blockchain. Even though use cases for SOL are appearing all the time, some amount of SOL remains to be not used in everyday DeFi.
Sibe allows you to receive SIBE in exchange for staking SOL, which in turn can be used in DeFi while keeping earning staking rewards.

## What is Sibe token?
Sibe is a staking derivative, which users get for staking SOL on the Sibe protocol. It serves as confirmation that SOL is staked. The system is transparent and reliable and allows users not only to get staking rewards but also to use tokens in DeFi.
