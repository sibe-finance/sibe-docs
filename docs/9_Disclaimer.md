Itâ€™s important to understand that participation in the Siberian protocol has some risks which in the worst case may be the reason you lose all of your funds invested in Sibe. Before starting you need to acknowledge that there are following risks: 

:::


* Since the distributed ledger technology is still not all settled in the legal field, the regulatory status of Siberian is unclear. There is no possibility to know for sure what kind of changes in law and regulations may appear in the future that can affect the legality of operations. 

*  Siberian protocol is still growing and developing. Even though we will do our best to keep in touch about our updates, there still can appear information disclosure to be insufficient. To sum up, this documentation has the most current information about the project, but it still can be adjusted and modified by the team in the future. 

* Considering the fact that the industry is getting more and more competitive, and the market of decentralized apps and networks is growing rapidly, there is a possibility that alternative networks are using the same or similar code and instruments to build their product. 
* Unfortunately, there are many different unpredictable aspects that can have a bad influence on the future of the project. For example, unbearable technical difficulties or shortage of funds. 
* Not to forget, there is always a possibility that there may be an attempt to interfere with Siberian from external sources, which may lead to some safety issues. 
* To our regret, this list of risks is not exhaustive. More of those may appear as the combinations of already mentioned ones or as unexpected variations.
